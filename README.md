This project focuses on analyzing **medical device, food, and drug recall data** to identify 
            trends and insights related to **recalls across different product types**. The key objectives include:

- **Data Exploration**: Investigate the various types of recalls across medical devices, food, and drugs, and their associated categories.
- **Visual Insights**: Utilize interactive visualizations to represent recall counts and product types effectively.
- **User Interaction**: Provide a user-friendly interface for filtering data based on product type, recall category, and company.

This analysis aims to enhance understanding of recent recall trends and improve overall management of medical devices, food, and drugs by comparing 
            recalls across different industries.
          

### Context:
**Medical Device Classes**: based on the level of control necessary to provide reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness
- **Class I**: low to moderate risk
- **Class II**: moderate to high risk
- **Class III**: high risk
            
**Recall Classes**:
The recall classification indicates the severity of the potential health risks associated with the product:
- **Class I Recall**: A reasonable probability that the use of or exposure to a violative product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death.
- **Class II Recall**: Use of or exposure to a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences, or the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.
- **Class III Recall**: Use of or exposure to a violative product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences.
