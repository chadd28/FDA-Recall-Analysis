"Users of the FreeStyle Libre 3 sensors reported situations where they were receiving erroneously high glucose results. The inaccurate higher glucose values may lead to users calculating higher insulin bolus correctional doses based on inaccurate CGM glucose data. The inaccurate higher glucose values may also contribute to missed or delayed recognition of hypoglycemia, when the sensor incorrectly reports normal or even high glucose values when the actual glucose is trending low or is low. If the hypoglycemia missed by the device occurs acutely, a user may not be able to confirm the actual glucose with a self-monitored blood glucose (BG) and/or administer prompt intervention to raise glucose levels. The over-delivery of insulin and/or the missed or delayed detection of impending or overt hypoglycemia in the worst-case scenario may lead to severe hypoglycemia/hypoglycemic crisis with significant adverse health consequences. Such consequences include central nervous system dysfunction, loss of consciousness, seizure activity and may lead to coma, permanent neurological damage, and death.",Operation or Functional Issues,1.0

"When a DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer is connected to a Laboratory Automation System (LAS) and is running with the system software versions 1.17.0 and below, the analyzer does not send a message to the LAS when the sample wheel is full, and the LAS continues sending samples despite the limited capacity to process new samples.  Therefore, sample tests may be aliquoted but not processed when the number of tests associated with onboard patient samples exceeds the throughput limit. If this issue occurs test results are flagged with a sample wheel timeout (SWT) error flag, and there may be a delay in reporting test results which could lead to a delay in patient treatment.",Design/Component Flaws,0.7525586485862732

"The reason for this recall is QuidelOrtho has determined that during normal use the VITROS XT ALB-TP Slides may shed dust and debris as they travel through the MicroSlide Subsystem of the VITROS XT 3400 or VITROS XT 7600 analyzer. This dust and debris may then settle onto VITROS Na+ (Sodium) Slides as they are processed through the same MicroSlide Subsystem, potentially resulting in an increase in non-reproducible, positively, or negatively biased Na+ results. The level of bias will depend on where the dust and debris settle on the Na+ MicroSlide and may impact Na+ measurements to varying degrees inside and outside of the measuring range depending on the amount of contamination. All of which could vary from no/low bias with no patient harm, to extreme bias (falsely elevated or reduced results) potentially resulting in incorrect diagnosis; treatment; and/or a serious patient health hazard (for example, hypernatremia or hyponatremia).  This issue may also potentially generate error codes preventing the analyzer from processing the MicroSlide Assays and cause delay of the patient results. All current and expired VITROS XT Chemistry Products ALB-TP slides are affected by this issue.",Contamination or Sterility Issues,1.0

"Beckman Coulter is recalling their DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzers, an in vitro diagnostic device used for the quantitative, semi-quantitative, or qualitative determination of various analyte concentrations found in human body fluids, by correction. The reason for the recall is: Beckman Coulter has determined that the DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay analyzer accepts calibrator values scanned from multiple calibrator cards when an operator configures a new calibrator lot. The analyzer accepts the calibrator lot values from any scanned calibrator card, regardless of the assay test code or calibrator material lot number. The software is not validating the integrity of each calibrator barcode scanned to ensure they are all from the same calibrator card. This includes all software versions and all DxI 9000 instruments that are currently in the field. This issue does not impact calibrator material with 2D calibrator card barcodes. This may cause a failed calibration curve. The health risk to patients is dependent upon the analytes that could be impacted by the error, to include receiving delayed or erroneous results. 

The issue was identified by Beckman Coulter while conducting a field action on DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzers.

"The reason for the recall is the pneumatic tubing used in the analytical pick-and-place (PnP) assembly cable may fully or partially disconnect from the flex cable assembly fittings during normal operation. The DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer may generate a System Event log message that indicates PnP errors. Any cancelled tests will have an associated SYS flag. The analyzer may enter the Red-system status because of this issue. The analyzer also may not eject RVs, where unbound conjugate could potentially splash up on the sidewall of the RV, not being properly washed away, resulting in an artificially higher signal (RLU). The analyzer may not detect this splashing and continue with normal operation, which can cause false low or high erroneous results. Consequently, the analyzer may cancel in-progress tests. These errors could potentially cause delay reporting patient test results and patient treatments. The degree of the potential health hazard is dependent on the analytes that are potentially delayed, especially those analytes that would be used in the acute setting when treatment decisions are immediate. In this particular recall the highest risk analyte is troponin. Health consequences could include permanent impairment or possibly death if medical treatment decisions are delayed due to a delay in obtaining patient results. The issue was identified by Beckman Coulter Inc. manufacturing staff at their location in Brea California on February 29, 2024, during in-process acceptance inspection activities.",Operation or Functional Issues,1.0

"Siemens Healthineers has identified an issue with the RAPIDPoint500e system software version 5.3. This issue affects how the sample source is identified at the LIS when using the capillary mode. With this software version, samples run in the capillary mode are incorrectly labeled as arterial when displayed on the LIS, leading to the potential for results to be flagged according to an established arterial range. Capillary sample results are correctly identified as capillary on both the RAPIDPoint 500e system display and the instrument printouts. The issue only affects the new software version 5.3 and only capillary sample mode is impacted. The inability to distinguish specimen sources for blood gas may lead to incorrect diagnoses and management decisions.",Design/Component Flaws,0.747323215007782

"The reason for recall is the meters may show an incorrect measurement unit (mmol/L rather than mg/dL) and may result in the wrong unit of measure.  Which may subsequently cause an error in interpreting a result as approximately 18 times lower that the actual blood glucose. Potential immediate health consequences of the glucose meter providing a reading in the wrong units of measurement (UOM) may result in inappropriate rescue therapy for presumed hypoglycemia including urgent and repeat administration of carbohydrates.  This in turn could lead to frequent episodes of hyperglycemia which is unrecognized and undertreated.Long range consequences of continued use of the affected meters could include mismanagement of the patient s diabetes for longer periods of time potentially resulting in a major health event (in general persistent and/or severe hyperglycemia) that may lead them to seek medical attention, and depending on the duration of hyperglycemia, could contribute to the development of microvascular (i.e., retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy) and/or macrovascular (i.e., myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke) complications of diabetes and could lead to fetal damage (abnormal fetal growth and altered organ development and maturation, fetal hypoxemia, spontaneous abortion, and congenital anomalies) in pregnant women.

"A force sensor in the occlusion detector may drift out of calibration leading to increased occlusion detection times, false occlusion alarms, or a System Failure Alarm. If the force sensor calibration shift is large enough, the pump will display a System Failure Alarm (including Force Sensor BGND Test, Force Sensor Bridge Test, or Force Sensor Test). However, if the calibration shift is not large enough to trigger a System Failure Alarm, the threshold to detect an occlusion may increase, increasing the time to occlusion detection, or the threshold may decrease, leading to false occlusion alarms.  Although shifts in the force sensor calibration may occur over time with any device, an increased potential for such shifts has been reported in devices produced before April 2022 due to mechanical interference between parts of the plunger head assembly.

"An error message was received when using the Omnipod 5 App on compatible smartphones that prevented phone control users from controlling the Omnipod 5 Automated Insulin Delivery System from their Omnipod 5 App which may cause a delay in therapy. To reduce the volume of inquiries Insulet was receiving from customers, an email was sent to all phone control users and the cause of the error message was resolved by reverting to prior certificates on the Insulet cloud to secure communications between the Omnipod 5 App sotware and the Insulet Cloud. This issue was limited to only certain compatible Android smartphones and did not affect the Omnipod 5 Pods or the dedicated locked-down Controller provided by Insulet. All other Omnipod 5 users were still able to manage their insulin with the device without use of the smartphone app and affected users were able to switch to the locked-down control provided to all users when they initiated the device during the time the App was unavailable to them. Further, the Omnipod itself continued to deliver insulin as per its pre-programmed settings so although affected users who did not have the locked-down controller readily available may not have been able to command insulin boluses during this time, they continued to receive basal insulin without interruption. Lastly, users of the Omnipod 5 were advised during training to always have backup supplies ready in the event of a device malfunction which would include alternative means to deliver insulin subcutaneously until the issue is resolved to minimize disruption to their insulin regimen. There were 2,168 complaints received out of 7,838 users with the Android compatible smartphones affected and  9 MDRs were submitted, however, there were no serious injuries reported or reports of erroneous results as the primary issue was a delay in therapy. This defect cannot cause false results that could negatively impact patients.",Operation or Functional Issues,1.0

"Firmware versions have the potential to mis-associate sample IDs leading to incorrect results or delayed sodium, potassium, and chloride patient results. Falsely increased or decreased electrolytes can lead to either inappropriate treatment of normal results, or failure to treat abnormal results resulting in abnormal levels. Abnormal potassium levels can result in weakness, polyuria, ileus, psychiatric disturbances, cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory depression, and death. Abnormal sodium levels can result in CNS disturbances and disturbances of water balance. Abnormal chloride levels can lead to acid base disturbances which can lead to respiratory and cardiac compromise. 

The event may occur only if all the following conditions occurs in few milliseconds  timeframe:
- The module is releasing a sample tube (Tube A) just placed into the carrier
- Another sample tube (Tube B) is erroneously not diverted into the module buffer lane due to a malfunction of the divert gate
Only in this specific scenario, the Tube A may be released by the module as Tube B due to a miscommunication between the module firmware and the Automation software without any error message.

The Automation System loses the traceability of Tube A. It manages both Tube A (incorrectly identified as Tube B) and the real Tube B according to the test orders not performed yet on Tube B.

Inpeco has released a Technical Service Bulletin with the procedure to correctly update the firmware. The firmware upgrade will be performed by Field Service Engineers.

Current device labeling does not clearly identify that these insulin pumps are capable of functioning with the default basal setting of 0.0 units/hr for all 24 hours and that no error message will appear if the default basal setting remains active. Furthermore, the labeling for the affected devices does not highlight that saving the basal settings requires multiple steps and failure to complete all steps will not save the new basal settings, nor that the steps required to set and save a basal profile and other parameters which are used as part of the bolus calculator function are different.",Operation or Functional Issues,1.0

"Due to potential performance issues with software version 3.2.3 and earlier.  Performance issues are:
1) There is the potential for onboard reagents past their lot expiration date or onboard stability time to be incorrectly displayed on the Reagent Status screen with a status of ""OK"". In this scenario, the expired
reagent will remain in the carousel for sample processing.
2) Performing monthly maintenance procedure 5701 Clean ICT Drain Tip incorrectly may potentially cause issues such as damaged connector or leaking
connection.
3) A sample exception with message code 150 ""Unable to process test. Previous processing module error"" is produced without notifying the operator of a reagent pipettor failure and may cause processing module to transition into the Pausing state. Tests initiated prior to the sample exception may continue to process
without dispense of reagents, potentially leading to incorrect results. 4. Reagent short dispense: Alinity c needs a control measure to protect against the potential for short reagent dispense. Addition of a maximum depth limit for reagent cartridges on the Alinity c to prevent the potential for a short dispense is needed.

"Early life failure of the ADUs only occurs when the hospital mains provide 480V to the system. This current voltage may lead to saturation and overheating of the coils that protect the IGBTs (insulated-gate bipolar transistor) of the ADU. 

The overheating may generate a peculiar burning smell that may be noticed. In some instances, this burning smell may be noticed before the ADU fails.

When the ADU fails the X-ray performance of the system is reduced to Emergency Fluoroscopy. Exposure will not be possible and image quality will be reduced.

"Siemens identified two issues, In some cases, it is possible to perform an image acquisition although more than 20% of the beam does not
hit the detector. This may only occur when an organ program for the wall mode without top alignment is selected and the system is moved to the centred position. If afterwards the operator activates the top alignment, increases the collimation, and lifts the tube, the system allows examination even with the tube
being misaligned to the detector position. Hence, it is possible to overshoot the detector by more than 20%. From a clinical point of view, it is highly unlikely for the operator to trigger the examination as the misalignment is visible due to the light field being out of range. 
AND In very rare cases it may occur that the calculated dose value exceeds the limit of 2 Gy. This may potentially occur only when an organ program for free exposure is selected, and the system uses incorrect (too small) source-to-image distance (SID) for calculating applied dose. Hence, the calculated dose is much higher than the actual applied dose causing the buzzer, which normally notifies the operator about the exceeded limit of 2 Gy, to get activated erroneously.",Design/Component Flaws,0.7140960693359375

If the unit for iCa++ is set to mg/dL (configured as Service Code MGL) and a measured iCa++ value is lower than the normal range, an upward arrow is shown on the display instead of a downward arrow. The display is set per default to mmol/L; therefore, the arrow indicating an alarm reflects normal ranges of iCa++ in mmol/L. If mg/dL is chosen, the arrow warnings on screen still reflect the ranges from mmol/L, rather than mg/dL. The numeric result is displayed correctly.",Design/Component Flaws,0.6988872289657593

"A software error results in the unintentional removal of the serum-indices flag that would otherwise prevent the release of results. The Cobas Inifinity has an auto-verification feature to hold results for manual review when they meet specific criteria. The serum indices flag is used for serum indices tests that are performed to assess the quality of the sample (e.g. hemolysis, icterus, and lipemia). Normally, when the Cobas Infinity receives a result for a test that is serum indices-sensitive, it flags the result and the software then waits for the results of the serum indices tests before validating or rejecting the test result. Roche has discovered a software error that under specific conditions causes the flag to be incorrectly removed. This allows for the possibility that a sample of poor quality may return an unreliable/incorrect test result that is mistakenly reported to the health care provider and/or patient without the proper disclaimer that the result is based on a sample of poor quality.",Design/Component Flaws,0.7347287535667419

"There is a software problem which affects the DSA Roadmap application on ARTIS Icono and ARTIS Pheno systems with software version VE20B. In rare cases, when the DSA acquisition has been started while the C-Arm or table is moving, there may be a shift between the image acquired at the start position and the image (i.e. DSA vessel map) taken at the reference position. This may lead to a DSA vessel map being overlaid to a subtracted fluoro image at a position that is not accurate.. However, if the displacement is slight or at an unfavorable plane, the user might rely on incorrect visualization of the catheter relative to the vessel map. This could imply danger to the patient.",Manufacturing Defects,1.0

"Opticross 35 Peripheral Imaging Catheter is being recalled because the incremental telescoping length markings near the proximal end of the catheter shaft can flake off when the device is manipulated. No patient harm has been reported to date. 

The most common potential adverse health consequence would be prolonged procedure to exchange the catheter for another as this potential issue is observable and has occurred outside of the patient's body. The most server health consequence that is reasonably expected to occur if a catheter with this potential issue is used is embolization which would result of the flaking marks advance while flushing the catheter.

All recalled devices should be returned to Boston Scientific.",Manufacturing Defects,1.0

"Signature from the user is necessary to proceed with specific actions in the Proton Therapy System (PTS). IBA became aware that the PTS does not accept user names with more than ten characters. It is an issue when the user has no other choice than resuming an aborted treatment field based on the overall delivered dose displayed on the Dose Counter Electronic Unit (DCEU). User s signature is required to perform this action. If the signature contains more than ten characters, the user will not be able to complete the aborted treatment field.

It is not possible, in a new session, to resume from a local partial archive if the Patient Positioning System (PPS) position has changed. If the user captures the PPS position at every session in the Oncology Information System (OIS) just after the setup process, the prescribed PPS position is changed for the next session in the OIS. This includes the partial continuation session. Therefore, when comparing the prescribed PPS position between OIS and local database, the PTS sees a difference and rejects the local partial archive.

The manufacturer identified a risk that their products might fail to comply with the cabinet x-ray system performance standard limit on x-ray emissions [21 CFR 1020.40(c)(1)] due to an insufficient safety margin for the means of attachment of a piece of interior x-ray shielding. Double sided industrial tape was used for attachment - there have been only 2 instances of detachment and although the piece of shielding detached it remained mostly in place supported by wires that pass through that piece of shielding.  The repair is accomplished by adding a bracket to fasten the piece of shielding securely to the inside of the x-ray system.  Mfr reports that no systems were found to have exceeded the emission limit when checked prior to repair.,Design/Component Flaws,0.7136949300765991
